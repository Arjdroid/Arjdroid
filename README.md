<h1> 👋 Hi, I’m @Arjdroid </h1>

- 👀 I’m currently interested in computer networking and video games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning school stuff and start many projects I don't finish...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of this moment
- 📫 Don't reach me
- I have a blog website [arjdroid.github.io](https://arjdroid.github.io) which I update sometimes
